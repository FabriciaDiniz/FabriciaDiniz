### Hey there 👋

----
My name is Fabrícia Diniz, my pronouns are **she/her**, I study web development since 2017 and I'm always looking for new ways to improve. I'm currently working at the wonderful [Intmed](https://intmed.com.br/) as a Fullstack developer.

🌱 I’m currently learning **JS**, **Angular** and **DRF** for work and **React** just for fun.
